# npm release workflow

This repository's `.github/workflows/publish.yml` verifies pull requests and supports manual **Run workflow** dispatches. `publish` defaults to **false**. Verification requires no npm login or enrolled environment. Publishing requires `publish=true`, an exact stable `expected_version` matching `package.json`, and the canonical `master` branch after this workflow is merged there. Never dispatch publication from a release-candidate branch.

## One-time operator setup (not automated)

1. In GitHub `suryast/x402-check` → Settings → Environments, manually create **npm**. Choose **Selected branches and tags**, add exactly one **Branch** rule named **master** (no tag rule/wildcard). Enable required reviewer **suryast**. Leave **Prevent self-review** unchecked so the sole owner can approve a manual run. No npm token or environment secret is needed.
2. In npm package **x402-validate** → Settings → Trusted publishing → GitHub Actions, enter owner **suryast**, repository **x402-check**, workflow filename **publish.yml**, environment **npm**. Permit direct `npm publish` for this publisher; this workflow does not implement staged publishing. Account setup and approval stay with the operator; never send passwords, 2FA codes or tokens to an agent.
3. Review and merge the source workflow, run verification-only first, then explicitly request publication of the reviewed manifest version and approve the GitHub environment deployment.

The GET-only preflight uses `contents: read` and `actions: read`. It checks the existing environment, required reviewer and exact branch rule **before** the environment-bound publishing job can be scheduled. Missing/forbidden/unreadable configuration fails closed; it never creates or repairs configuration. If your token/platform cannot read these endpoints, resolve permissions as an operator, not by adding an administrative token or write fallback. Do not change/delete environment rules while a release is running.

Build/test jobs have no OIDC permission. They pack with lifecycle scripts disabled and seal SHA-256, package name/version and checked-out source SHA. Node 18/24 consumer jobs verify and install the same tarball without install scripts, exercise modules and the CLI. Only the gated publish job has `id-token: write`; it rechecks all artifact bindings, requires a conclusive registry 404 for the exact version, and publishes that tarball using `--access public --provenance --ignore-scripts --tag latest`. The publish process uses empty npm config files and removes legacy token variables; no `npm whoami` or `NPM_TOKEN` fallback. It requires Node >=22.14.0/npm >=11.5.1 and uses Node 24 on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu 24.04.
